					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

							<h2>It's an easy choice.</h2>

								<h3>How does prepaid work?</h3>
								<p>You pay for nearly everything up front and get exactly what you pay for. Find the phone you want and buy it. Pick a plan, make a payment and add money to your account regularly to maintain service. That&rsquo;s all you have to do.</p>
								<p>There are no annual contracts, no credit checks, no monthly bills, no overage fees and no roaming charges.</p>
								<p>Prepaid plans offer daily and monthly payment options. To keep your service going, just make sure you have enough money in your account for the next payment cycle.</p>
							</div>
						</section>

							<div>
								<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
								<p>Aside from what we mentioned above &ndash; the cost. When you choose prepaid, you pay for most of the cost of your phone at the beginning and save immediately by paying less for your service. When you purchase a phone and commit to a two-year contract, you may save some money on cost of the phone at the beginning, but you&rsquo;re actually paying for that phone each month since a portion of the cost is included in your monthly wireless bill.</p>
								<p>The result? A prepaid smartphone plan on Boost can cost as little as $35 a month. A smartphone plan on a postpaid contract plan often can end up costing you $100 a month or more.</p>
								<p>Plus, prepaid plans give you flexibility. If you don&rsquo;t like your service, you&rsquo;re not locked in to a long-term commitment.</p>
							</div>
						</section>
						<section>
							<img src="bst/img/badge_person.png"></img>
							<div>
								<h3>How do I know if it's right for me?</h3>
								<p>You want control over your budget, right? With prepaid, you make your payment upfront, so you know exactly how much you&rsquo;ll spend from the start and how much you&rsquo;ll pay each month. Don&rsquo;t get hit with hidden fees or other surprise charges. What&rsquo;s even better, prepaid lets you upgrade your phone when you&rsquo;re ready, so you don&rsquo;t have to wait around to see when you&rsquo;re eligible for a new phone.</p>
								<p>If you don&rsquo;t use your phone much or need a quick replacement, choose a super-affordable basic phone. If you want all the latest bells and whistles, find a smartphone that fits your needs and budget.</p>
