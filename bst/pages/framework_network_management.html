					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

							<h2 class="font-boostneo-light">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT NETWORK MANAGEMENT</h2>
							
							<p class="align_content">Sprint is committed to providing the best mobile broadband 
							Internet access service experience possible for its customers. To ensure that all 
							Sprint customers enjoy the best possible network experience, Sprint uses reasonable 
							network management practices that are consistent with mobile broadband industry 
							standards and guidance provided by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
							Sprint's network management practices are primarily used for and tailored to achieving 
							legitimate network management purposes taking into account Sprint's network architecture 
							and technology.</p>
							
							<p class="align_content">The following Frequently Asked Questions are intended to 
							help clarify for Boost Mobile customers what we mean by network management and 
							explain Sprint's network management techniques and approaches.
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">Why does Sprint manage its network?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">Sprint manages its network with the goal of delivering 
							the best possible mobile broadband Internet access experience to all of its retail 
							customers. Mobile network resources are not infinite. Managing the network is 
							essential to promote the use and enjoyment of mobile data by all network users. 
							Sprint uses reasonable network management practices that are consistent with 
							industry standards for protecting Sprint's network and customers and for managing 
							the delivery of mobile broadband services. Just as the Internet continues to change 
							and evolve, so too, will Sprint's network management practices to address the 
							challenges and threats on the Internet.
							</p>
							
							<p class="align_content">If Sprint didn't manage its network, network users 
							would be subject to the negative effects of spam, viruses, security attacks, 
							network congestion, and other risks and degradations of the service. By engaging 
							in reasonable and responsible network management, Sprint can deliver the best 
							possible mobile broadband Internet access experience to all users of the network.
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">How does Sprint manage its network?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">Sprint uses various tools and techniques to manage its network 
							and deliver its services. These tools and techniques are dynamic, like the Sprint network 
							and its usage, and Sprint may update the tools and techniques it uses. Sprint's network 
							management activities include managing congestion and allocating resources among users 
							on the network, optimizing certain content and applications, identifying spam and 
							preventing its delivery to customers, detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing 
							the distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content, and using other tools and 
							techniques that Sprint may be required to implement in order to meet its goal of allowing 
							Boost Mobile to deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers.
							</p>
							<p></p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">How does Sprint manage congestion on the network?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">Sprint employs a holistic approach to managing congestion on 
							its data network. Sprint's first goal is to avoid congestion altogether by directing 
							traffic to the best available spectrum resources and cell sites. Sprint also attempts 
							to avoid congestion by managing tonnage on its network. Finally, when congestion does occur, 
							meaning that the demand on a particular sector temporarily exceeds the ability of that 
							sector to meet the demand, Sprint relies on the radio scheduling software provided by 
							Sprint's hardware vendors to allocate resources to users. 
							</p>
							
							<p class="align_content"><em>Techniques to Direct Traffic to the Best 
							Available Spectrum Resources and Cell Sites:</em> All mobile networks, 
							including Sprint's, employ a Radio Access Network ("RAN") that manages 
							connectivity between mobile client devices and the core network. The RAN 
							functions to identify mobile devices permitted to access the network and 
							their locations and assigns the mobile device to an available frequency band 
							and cell site serving the location. The RAN also controls device "hand off" 
							between neighboring cell site resources to balance load across network 
							resources or as a mobile device moves from one location to another. Sprint's 
							RAN manages connections between mobile devices and cell sites operating on multiple 
							frequency bands (800 MHz, 1.9 GHz, 2.5 GHz) and multiple air interfaces (CDMA, EVDO, LTE). 
							As part of managing those connections, Sprint's RAN is designed to dynamically connect 
							customers to the best available spectrum resources and cell sites—and reassign those 
							connections as circumstances change.
							</p>
							
							<p class="align_content"><em>Managing Tonnage: </em>The majority of Sprint's traffic 
							management efforts are aimed at avoiding congestion by managing the total volume of 
							data transmitted, referred to colloquially as "tonnage." Sprint manages tonnage by 
							optimizing certain applications on the network such as video and web traffic. This 
							optimization improves page load times and reduces video stalling, while also eliminating 
							wasted data transmissions that result from lack of coordination between applications, t
							he network, and a device (for example, stopping transmission of a video after a customer 
							has stopped viewing it). It also matches media transmission quality to the capability of 
							the device viewing the media.</p>
							
							<p class="align_content"><em>Allocating Resources During Times of Congestion:</em> 
							Despite its best efforts to prevent congestion through managing tonnage and 
							directing customers to the best available network resources, the demand on a 
							particular network sector sometimes temporarily exceeds the ability of that 
							sector to meet the demand. During these times, Sprint relies on the radio scheduling 
							software provided by Sprint's hardware vendors to allocate resources to users. This 
							radio scheduling software includes a set of generic fairness algorithms that allocate 
							resources based on signal quality, number of users, and other metrics. These algorithms 
							are active at all times, whether or not the cell is congested; however, during times of 
							congestion, the algorithms operate with the goal of ensuring that no single user is 
							deprived of access to the network. 
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">How does congestion management impact me and my data services?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">The goal of congestion management is to ensure that all users 
							during times of congestion have access to a fair share of the network resources and 
							that no user is starved of resources. When congestion occasionally occurs, customers 
							may experience reduced throughput or speed compared to their normal experience on non-congested sites.
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">How often does Sprint use congestion management?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">Because of the peaked nature of mobile data traffic, congestion 
							management software is actively looking for network congestion at all times. When it detects 
							congestion, the fairness algorithms described above operate with the goal of ensuring that all 
							customers are allocated a fair share of network resources.
							</p>
							<p class="align_content">To help reduce congestion, Sprint evaluates its overall network 
							performance and enhances its network by adding capacity or making other network adjustments 
							to help improve network performance</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">Does Sprint employ any type of data compression or optimization on the Sprint network today?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">Yes, Sprint deploys network optimization capabilities for video 
							and web traffic on the Sprint Wireless Network. Intent is to improve overall user experience 
							and increase network efficiency. Optimization helps improve page load times and reduces video 
							stalling. The optimization technology provides for the elimination of wasted data transmission 
							that results from lack of coordination between applications, network, and device, for example 
							stopping transmission of video after a customer has stopped viewing it. It also matches media 
							transmission quality to the capability of the device viewing the media.
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">What specific types of optimization does Sprint employ?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">Video optimization is deployed for RTSP and HTTP video traffic 
							and all HTTP web traffic. Video optimization is always deployed and active on the Sprint 
							network for all identifiable video traffic. Although the purpose of the optimization techniques 
							is to improve overall video viewing experience, it is possible that some users may experience 
							minor discernable reductions in image quality when viewing video traffic on certain devices. 
							These reductions should generally be offset by improvement s in load times and reductions in 
							ideo stalling and other experience improvements. Sprint's video optimization uses four basic 
							technologies:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li class="bullets_min">Video Delivery Synchronization: Delivers video "just in time" to the mobile device. Intent is to eliminate network waste associated with transmitting video that isn't watched.</li>
								<li class="bullets_min">Quality Aware Transcoding. Matches video quality with network conditions in real time. Optimizes video for the bandwidth available to the user. Intent is to minimize or eliminate annoying video stalling. Similar in concept to the optimization techniques already employed by sites using adaptive streaming.</li>
								<li class="bullets_min">Video Transcoding: Transcodes video with intent to optimize the video experience for the user while efficiently using network bandwidth. Provides for the elimination of video waste using techniques like replacing less efficient video codecs with more efficient ones. Optimizes video for the mobile device the customer is using.</li>
								<li class="bullets_min">Intelligent Caching: Caches optimized video in the network with the intent of eliminating delay associated with internet video sites.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p class="align_content">Note that some customer may choose plans that include throughput 
							limits for streaming video applications. Refer to your specific plan materials for information 
							on video streaming policies relating to your plan.
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">What specific types of web optimization does Sprint employ?</h3>
							<p class="align_content"> Web optimization is deployed for all HTTP web traffic and 
							is always deployed and active on the Sprint network for all identifiable web traffic. 
							Although the purpose of the optimization techniques is to improve overall web viewing 
							experience, it is possible that some users may experience minor discernable reductions 
							in image quality when viewing web traffic on certain devices. These reductions should 
							generally be offset by improvement s in load times and other experience improvements. 
							Web optimization uses three basic technologies:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li class="bullets_min">Caching: Caches web pages to help avoid delays associated with retrieval of the same internet content multiple times</li>
								<li class="bullets_min">Text/Binary Compression: Lossless compression of data and binary files using standard compression techniques supported by HTTP-compliant browsers.</li>
								<li class="bullets_min">Image Compression: JPEG and GIF compression designed to reduce the size of images while maintaining no user perceptible loss of quality.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">Does Sprint have any prohibited applications or uses? </h3>
							<p class="align_content">Yes, Sprint broadband internet access services are 
							intended to be used for web surfing, sending and receiving email, photographs 
							and other similar messaging activities, and the non-continuous streaming of 
							videos, downloading of files or on line gaming. To ensure the activities of 
							some users do not impair the ability of our customers to have access to reliable 
							services, Sprint prohibits use of our services in a manner that harms or unduly 
							interferes with Sprint's network or systems or poses a security risk. Refer 
							to <a href="#!/framework_product_terms_conditions/">boostmobile.com/about/legal/terms-conditions/product-terms-conditions/</a> 
							for more information. 
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">Does Boost Mobile have rules regarding the attachment of devices to its network by customers?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">Any device certified as being Sprint network compatible may be used 
							on the Sprint network including compatible devices not purchased from Boost Mobile. Information 
							about Sprint compatible devices can be found on Sprint's website at: <a href="http://support.sprint.com/support/devicelistpage" target="new">support.sprint.com/support/devicelistpage</a>. 
							Boost Mobile/Sprint will not activate devices that have been reported as lost or stolen or associated 
							with accounts that are found not to be in good standing.
							</p>
							
							<p class="align_content">Manufacturers and developers who want to develop products 
							for use on the Sprint's network can find information and assistance through Sprint's 
							developer tools located at: <a href="http://developer.sprint.com" target="new">developer.sprint.com</a> 
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="color_orange">Do device software upgrades affect the performance of my device on Sprint's network?</h3>
							<p class="align_content">From time to time, Boost may push software updates to 
							your device to improve device features, security, and performance. These updates 
							may include components that optimize the way your device and application on the 
							device use network resources by, for example, managing connections between a 
							user's wifi networks and the Sprint network or by managing the intervals at 
							which certain background application connect to the network. Updates that 
							manage radio resources are intended to improve performance and device battery 
							life while also maintaining a high quality user experience.
